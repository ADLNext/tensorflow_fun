In the `lightweight` folder create a new file:

```
from A to B
from B to A
from A to B
from B to A
from A to B
===
from C to D
from D to C
from C to D
===
from E to F
from F to E
from E to F
from F to E
```

To use your conversation file `<name>.txt`, copy it in the directory and launch the program with the option `--corpus lightweight --datasetTag <name>`.
