# Fun with TensorFlow

A repo to host cool experiments with TensorFlow.

Please contribute with your experiments!!
Just make sure that the code is well commented and add a little description in the README so that others know what you've been up to.

## What's in this repo

- `QA_attention.py`: TF implementation of a sporadic memory network for context modelling and question answering. The script will download the dataset if not already in the current directory (might take a few mins); it took me ~10 hours to get good results, training on a GTX1060. The code contains comments with links to papers/resources.
